# This is a project that is based on HTML CSS and JavaScript.I am going to create a personal portfolio website based on the classes that I have taken all these semesters. I choose to do this project because I think a personal portfolio website is a much-needed factor for all the students who are in search of internships or job. Since your portfolio shows the compilation of relevant work samples and documents gathered during your school years, it is necessary tool to show your beliefs, skills, qualifications, education, training and experiences.

# This Will be updated in future,and instructor can find updates on the project with latest commits
